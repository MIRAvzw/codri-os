About
=====

This set of scripts allows you to create, configure and finalize a brand new
root filesystem. Note that this excludes a bootloader, kernel, and any modules
(or other hardware-specific files) to get your device to boot.


create
------

This script creates and populates a new root filesystem, using the Debian multistrap
tool. You need to specify the "ARCH" variable in your main profile settings, and provide
a valid multistrap.conf file.


configure
---------

This script configures some common aspects of your system (needing some settings, see below)
and copies user-specified configuration files into the root filesystem.

Needed variables:
	CONSOLE
	HOSTNAME
	DOMAIN


Prerequisites
=============

Basic set of apps:
	multistrap coreutils makedev

If running on a foreign architecture:
	binfmt-support qemu qemu-user-static
