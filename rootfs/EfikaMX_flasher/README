This profile provides a rootfs which flashes an image at '/turtleos.tar' to the
internal SSD at '/dev/sda'.

NOTE: it isn't a complete profile, but is rather to be used as overlay on a regular
profile. First, create your hardware-dependent profile (e.g. the EfikaMX one), copy
the rootfs, and reconfigure that copy with this profile. This'll copy the additional
files required to flash the image, over the already working base image.

After that, enter the flasher rootfs using chroot, and perform the following tasks:
 - remove unneeded services (puppet, openssh-client, cron, watchdog)
 - remove unneeded initialization scripts (firstboot.sh)
 - install parted and pv
